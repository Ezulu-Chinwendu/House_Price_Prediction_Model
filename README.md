## House Price Prediction Model

### Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using the XGBoost algorithm. The model analyzes features such as square footage, grade, number of bathrooms, and location to provide accurate house price estimates. Itâ€™s optimized through hyperparameter tuning and evaluated for performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSLE.

### Features

1. Feature Analysis: Includes square footage, grade, bathrooms, location, etc.
2. Model: XGBoost Regressor for accurate price predictions.
3. Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
4. Evaluation: Metrics such as R-squared and RMSLE to assess accuracy.
